WEEKLY UPDATES LOG

Weekly Progress - April 7â€“11

Project: Groupings Web App (React)  
CodeSandbox: [codesandbox.io/p/github/jadeambos123/Groupings](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/jadeambos123/Groupings)  
GitHub Repo: [jadeambos123/Groupings](https://github.com/jadeambos123/Groupings)

Overview

This week was focused mostly on building the project directly inside CodeSandbox. We worked on combining each memberâ€™s code into one system and organizing the components. GitHub was set up a bit late in the process, mainly to host the final version and documentation of the project.

What We Did

System Integration  
- Merged all individual files and components into one CodeSandbox project.  
- Organized the file structure for better readability.  
- Added basic routing using React Router (react-router-dom).  

UI & Pages  
- Worked on the layout for:
  - Home page
  - Grouping display  
- Started styling with CSS Modules.  

GitHub Integration  
- Created the GitHub repo after development started.  
- Pushed the CodeSandbox project to GitHub using the built-in GitHub integration.  
- Verified that syncing worked (after a few hiccups).  

Challenges

We had a few challenges this week:

- GitHub was set up late, so we had to focus on development first and sync everything afterward.  
- CodeSandbox gave us a 502 error at one point. We fixed it by restarting the dev server and clearing memory.  
- There was a CSS error in `Home.css` that caused the build to fail. We found a stray closing bracket and fixed it.  
- We were a bit confused at first with `pnpm install` and `pnpm start`, but we figured it out after checking the docs.  

Lessons & Next Steps  
- Don't wait too long to set up version control next time.  
- CodeSandbox is helpful for collaboration, but it can lag or break if overused.  
- Next step is to finalize the functionality and prepare for documentation and presentation.

ðŸ“Œ Notes  
This README serves as a weekly log of what weâ€™ve done so far for our IT223 Web System & Technologies project. GitHub will mainly hold our final version and documents, but most development happened in CodeSandbox.
